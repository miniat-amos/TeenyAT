# teenyat-assembly-language README

This extension provides syntax color highlighting in VS Code for the
TeenyAT assembly language as supported by the TeenyAT assembler, tnasm.
Since the syntax file uses the TextMate format, which is extremely
popular, it is very likely you can get this highlighter working in
editors or IDEs other than VS Code.  If you do, please contact the
TeenyAT team with details so we can add them to this documentation.

Happy coding!

## Installation with VS Code

Copy the entire folder this REAMDE resides in to the
`<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart VS Code.  It's coloring
should then be applied to .asm and .tnasm files.
